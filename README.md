# Metasploit-Nessus-DDos-nmap
[Documentation.pdf](https://github.com/NaddSafety/Metasploit-Nessus-DDos-nmap/files/15052804/ddoss.pdf)


<h1>Description</h1>

this lab delves into various aspects of network security operations and exploitation techniques. Participants engage in hands-on activities such as setting up virtual machines, conducting packet analysis with Wireshark, executing ARP spoofing attacks, performing DDoS attacks, port scanning with Nmap, vulnerability scanning using Nessus, and exploiting systems with the Metasploit framework.

<h1>Impact</h1>

it equips participants with practical skills in cybersecurity operations and offensive security techniques. By simulating real-world scenarios, participants gain valuable insights into the tools and methodologies used by both attackers and defenders. The hands-on nature of the lab enhances learning outcomes and prepares participants to tackle cybersecurity challenges effectively.

<h1>Tools Used</h1>

- VirtualBox and VMware Workstation for virtual machine setup
- Kali Linux for penetration testing and network analysis
- Wireshark for packet capture and analysis
- Nmap for port scanning and reconnaissance
- Nessus for vulnerability scanning and assessment
- Metasploit framework for exploitation and post-exploitation activities
